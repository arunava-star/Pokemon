Pokémon Finder Website

The Pokémon Finder is a web-based application designed to fetch and display Pokémon data using the Pokémon API (PokeAPI). Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this interactive app provides a platform for users to explore the first 50 Pokémon and search for specific ones by name.
The application’s primary feature is its Pokémon list, which dynamically fetches and displays the first 50 Pokémon, including their names and images, from the API. Users can scroll through the neatly designed cards, each showcasing an individual Pokémon.
An intuitive search functionality allows users to look up specific Pokémon by entering their name. The app efficiently retrieves the corresponding data and displays it in real-time. Error handling is a critical feature of the application, ensuring that users receive meaningful feedback when a search query fails (e.g., "Pokémon not found") or if the API resource does not load properly.
The responsive design, created with CSS, ensures the app functions seamlessly on various devices, providing an engaging user experience. JavaScript powers the interactivity, using the Fetch API to make asynchronous requests to the Pokémon API.
Key challenges addressed during development include managing API response errors, creating a visually appealing and responsive layout, and handling edge cases like invalid Pokémon names or missing data.
This project showcases fundamental web development skills, focusing on API integration, interactive user interfaces, and robust error handling. It serves as an excellent example of combining creativity with technical proficiency in building modern web applications.
